You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int,int> umap ;
        for(auto &val : nums){
            umap[val]++;
        }// counting the frequency....

        int res = 0 ;

        for(auto x : umap){
            int freq = x.second ;
            if(freq == 1)return -1;
            res += freq/3 ;
            if(freq%3) res += 1;
        }// making greedy decisions, 
        /* need to minimize the number of operations to make the array empty. 
        
        what you will do to minimize those operations ?
        1) need to combine more elements at once  ,it means use combination of 3 as much as possible because 3 is highest number of elements that we can combine here.
        
        2) if you combine all elements with 3 , and remainder == 1, handle that case 
        eg, freq = 25 
        25/3 = 8 and 25%3 = 1 
        how do we handle this type of case -->
        25 = 21 + 4
        21 give 7 ways(21/3 = 7)
        4 give 2 ways(4/2 = 2)
        so total = 9 ways. 
       qUES) Now the ques is how will you handle this case in your code ?
        ans) 1 way is you could do this way - 
                    25+2)/3
            2nd way you could do this way - 
            res += freq/3
            if(freq % 3 == 1 or freq % 3 == 2) then res += 1 (why ?)
            Because if remainder = 2 , then add 1 as we can combine 2.
            but if it is 1 , then see the case of 25 , how did we handle that case.

        return res ;
    }
};
