Description:- 
```
You are given an n x n integer matrix grid.

Generate an integer matrix maxLocal of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such that:

maxLocal[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1 and column j + 1.
In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.

Return the generated matrix.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[9,9,8,1],[5,6,2,6],[8,2,6,4],[6,2,2,2]]
Output: [[9,9],[8,6]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the original matrix and the generated matrix.
Notice that each value in the generated matrix corresponds to the largest value of a contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,2,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
Explanation: Notice that the 2 is contained within every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length == grid[i].length
3 <= n <= 100
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
```

Solution:- 
```Time Complexity:- O(n^2) Space:- O(1) 
Resizing of 2d vector is used because Using new vector to store the result was causing TLE.
So, I have resized the input vector to n-2 size.

Note:-
**For Resizing the 2d-vector, you need to first resize the full vector(external), need to resized internal vector also.**
```
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largestLocal(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
     int n = grid.size() ;
        //vector<vector<int>> res(n-2,vector<int>(n-2)) ;


     for(int i = 1 ; i < n-1 ;i++){
        for(int j = 1 ; j < n-1 ; j++){
            int temp = 0 ;

            for(int k = i-1 ; k <= i+1 ;k++){
                for(int l=j-1 ; l <= j+1 ;l++){
                    temp = max(temp,grid[k][l]);
                }
            }
            //res[i-1][j-1] = temp ;
            grid[i-1][j-1] = temp ;
        }
     }

      //grid.resize(n-2,vector<int>(n-2)) ;
      grid.resize(n-2);
      for(int i = 0 ; i < n; i++){
        grid[i].resize(n-2);
      }
      return grid ;
    }
};
```
